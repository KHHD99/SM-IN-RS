# Similarity metrics investigation in recommender systems
In this project we conduct an extensive simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the similarity metrics in recommender system, using 7 datasets and tested by the most common performance evaluation metrics.

# Project Overview
This project is a machine learning project that aims to investigate the similarity of in recommender systems. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, training several machine learning models, and selecting the best similarity metric that perform well based on evaluation metrics.

# Technologies Used
  - Python 3
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn

# Datasets
The datasets used in this project are the followings:
  - Group-lens datasets: 
    - Datasets from the Movie-Lens https://movielens.org have been compiled and made accessible by Group-Lens Research. The datasets were collected during various time periods, depending on their size (100K, 1M, 10M, 20M, 25M)
    - In the this project we used the MovieLens 100k, 1M, 10M https://grouplens.org/about/what-is-grouplens/ and the datasets can be accessible here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
