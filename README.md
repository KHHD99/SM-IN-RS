# Similarity metrics investigation in recommender systems
In this project we conduct an extensive simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the similarity metrics in recommender system, using 7 datasets and tested by the most common performance evaluation metrics.

# Project Overview
This project is a machine learning project that aims to investigate the similarity of in recommender systems. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, training several machine learning models, and selecting the best similarity metric that perform well based on evaluation metrics.

# Technologies Used
  - Python 3
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
 
# Datasets
The datasets used in this project are the followings:
  - Group-lens datasets: 
    - Datasets from the Movie-Lens (https://movielens.org) have been compiled and made accessible by Group-Lens Research. The datasets were collected during various time periods, depending on their size (100K, 1M, 10M, 20M, 25M)
    - In the this project we used the MovieLens 100k, 1M, 10M (https://grouplens.org/about/what-is-grouplens/) and the datasets can be accessible here (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

  - Jester dataset : 
    - A dataset from the Jester Joke, the dataset comprises feedback on 100 jokes from 73,496 users, with a total of 4.1 million ratings ranging from -10.00 to +10.00, (https://grouplens.org/datasets/jester/).

  - Epinions dataset : 
    - The Epinions dataset, which is openly accessible and commonly employed in the research of recommender systems, includes ratings provided by users for items and explicit trust/distrust relationships between users. Users assess other users based on the quality of their reviews about the item, (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoud3/epinions-trust-network).
    
  - MovieTweetings dataset : 
    - A Movie Rating Dataset Collected From Twitter. The MovieTweetings dataset comprises ratings of movies that were expressed in well-organized tweets on Twitter. It was produced as a part of a research project by Simon Dooms (http://scholar.google.be/citations?user=owaD8qkAAAAJ) from Ghent University, Belgium, and presented during the CrowdRec 2013 workshop at the ACM RecSys 2013 conference.
    
  - Electronics dataset : 
  -   - A collection of approximately 15,000 electronic products containing pricing information in 10 areas. Datafiniti's Product Database provides a list of over 15,000 electrical items with pricing information across 10 key variables. The dataset also includes brand, category, merchant, name, source, and other information (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/electronic-products-prices).
